# Work Hours Tracker PWA

Work Hours Tracker is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to help you keep track of your working hours. With its simple and interactive interface, you can easily log your hours and monitor your work schedule.

## Features

- **Interactive Calendar**: The application displays a calendar where you can log your working hours for each day. The calendar functionality is implemented in [calendar.js](js/calendar.js).

- **Work Hours Logging**: You can easily log your work hours for each day. The application will store your data and allow you to review it at any time.

- **Offline Functionality**: Thanks to the service worker ([service-worker.js](service-worker.js)), the application caches resources for offline use. This means you can log your hours even when you're offline, and the data will be synced when you're back online.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application is styled using a CSS file ([style.css](style.css)) to provide a clean and intuitive user interface.

## Usage

To use the application, open [index.html](index.html) in a web browser. The main application logic is in [main.js](main.js).

## Installation

As a PWA, this application can be installed on any PWA-supporting platform, including desktop and mobile devices. To install it, navigate to the application in your web browser and use the browser's installation feature.
